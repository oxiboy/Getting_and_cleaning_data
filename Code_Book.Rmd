The run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition.\

>1. **Download the dataset**

* The folder called UCI HAR Dataset

>2. **Assign each data to variable**

* fectures = features.txt: 561 rows, 2 columns

* activities = activity_label.txt: 6 rows, 2 columns

* subject_test = test/subject_test.txt: 2947 rows , 1 column

* X_test = test/X_test: 2947 rows, 561 columns

* y_test = test/y_test: 2947, 1 column

* subject_train = train/subject_train.txt: 7352 rows, 1 column

* X_train = train/X_train.txt: 7352 rows, 561 columns

* y_train = train/y_train.txt: 7352 rows, 1 column

>3. **Merges the training set and the test set to create one**

* X (10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by merging X_train and X_test

* Y (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging y_train and y_test

* subject (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging subject_train and subject_test

* total_data (10299,563 columns) is created by merge X, Y and subject

>4. **Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation of each variable**

* tidy(10299 rows, 80 columns) is created by select sample, Activity and the mean, standard deviation for each measurement

>5. **Uses descriptive activity names to introduce the activities in the data set **

* replace the sample column in the tidy data

>6. **Aproprietely labels in the data set**

* All acc in column's names replaces to Acelerometer

* All Gyro in column's names replaces to Gyroscope 

* All BodyBody in column's names replaces to Body

* All Mag in column's names replaces to Magnitude

* All start with character f in column's names replace by Frequency

* All start with character t in column's names replace by Time

>7. **From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject**

* final (180 rows, 80 columns) is created by summarizing tidy taking the group by of sample and activity and showing the mean of every variable

* Export final into final.txt
